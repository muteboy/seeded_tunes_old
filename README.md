# seeded_tunes
This is a project to take a single seed number and generate:
* information about a fictional "record label"...
  * with multiple fictional "artists" attached...
    * each with multiple fictional "albums" released...
      * each with multiple tracks
      
**_With a single seed, a whole discography is created!_**

The label has:
* a range of years during which they were active

Each artist has:
* a name generated using a random nonsense word generator
* personnel generated by selection from lists
* a range of years during which they were active

Each album by each artist has:
* a title generated using random nonsense words
* a year of release
* abstract artwork generated in [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)

Each track on each album has:
* a title generated using random nonsense words
* generated music files created for use in [cSound](http://csound.com/) which will create actual music.

The label, artists, people, and albums will also be represented on a "Rock Family Tree", of the style created by [Pete Frame](https://familyofrock.net/)
